## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

##  This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m<-NULL
  setinverse<- function(m) m<<-m
  getinverse<- function() m
  list(setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special 
##"matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
##then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m<-x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  m<-solve(x)
  x$setinverse(m)
}
